Package: classifly
Title: Explore classification models in high dimensions
Description: Given $p$-dimensional training data containing
    $d$ groups (the design space), a classification
    algorithm (classifier) predicts which group new data
    belongs to.  Generally the input to these algorithms is
    high dimensional, and the boundaries between groups
    will be high dimensional and perhaps curvilinear or
    multi-faceted. This package implements methods for
    understanding the division of space between the groups.
